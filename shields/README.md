# Pytrack, Pysense and Pyscan libraries

## Introduction
This directory contains libraries and out of the box examples for Pysense, Pytrack, and Pyscan, both versions 1 and 2.0x of these shields.

1. Upload all the files to your module
2. Open Pymakr
3. Run an example that matches to your shield

Note: For using Pyscan, you need to upload either MFRC630.mpy or MFRC630.py.
It is always recommended to use MFRC630.mpy as it takes less space on your module.
